# Deploying to Heroku with Voila

[Voila](https://voila.readthedocs.io/) is one of the quickest and easiest ways for you as a beginner to deploy your work. 
It works by transforming your Jupyter notebook into something like a webpage.

It is an option on various deployment platforms, one of which is [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com). 

Heroku gives you different options for how to create your web application, including proper web applications in Python, Ruby, PHP, Node.js etc. 
In this guide we are simply going to create a free account and deploy your first model using Voila and your Jupyter notebook.

# Prerequisites

You should have an exported model and a Jupyter notebook which functions as your demo. 
Chapter 2 of the fastai book discusses how to use Jupyter widgets to create a UI for your classifier demo.
