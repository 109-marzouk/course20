The videos are all captioned and also translated into Chinese (简体中文) and Spanish; while watching the video click the \"CC\" button to turn them on and off, and the setting button to change the language.\n",

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is the most popular tool for doing data science in Python, for good reason. It is powerful, flexible, and easy to use. We think you will love it! Since the most important thing for learning deep learning is writing code and experimenting, it's important that you have a great platform for experimenting with code.\n",

A lot of people assume that you need all kinds of hard-to-find stuff to get great results with deep learning, but as you'll see in this book, those people are wrong.

    "- **Natural language processing (NLP)** Answering questions; speech recognition; summarizing documents; classifying documents; finding names, dates, etc. in documents; searching for articles mentioning a concept\n",
    "- **Computer vision** Satellite and drone imagery interpretation (e.g., for disaster resilience); face recognition; image captioning; reading traffic signs; locating pedestrians and vehicles in autonomous vehicles\n",
    "- **Medicine** Finding anomalies in radiology images, including CT, MRI, and X-ray images; counting features in pathology slides; measuring features in ultrasounds; diagnosing diabetic retinopathy\n",
    "- **Biology** Folding proteins; classifying proteins; many genomics tasks, such as tumor-normal sequencing and classifying clinically actionable genetic mutations; cell classification; analyzing protein/protein interactions\n",
    "- **Image generation** Colorizing images; increasing image resolution; removing noise from images; converting images to art in the style of famous artists\n",
    "- **Recommendation systems** Web search; product recommendations; home page layout\n",
    "- **Playing games** Chess, Go, most Atari video games, and many real-time strategy games\n",
    "- **Robotics** Handling objects that are challenging to locate (e.g., transparent, shiny, lacking texture) or hard to pick up\n",
